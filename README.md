    <p>
        This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of district-wise IPC crimes in India
        from 2017 onwards. Using an official multi-year dataset, the study explores offence-wise
        crime patterns across districts and states, highlighting temporal trends, geographic
        hotspots, and variations across crime categories.
