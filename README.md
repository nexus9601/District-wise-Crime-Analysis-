This repository contains a data analysis project on district-wise IPC crimes in India from 2017 onwards, using an official multi-year dataset with detailed offence-wise counts at district level.

Objectives / Problem Statements
This analysis focuses on the following core questions:
1. Temporal trends
---How have major IPC crime categories evolved from 2017 onwards at national, state, and district levels?
​
2.Geographic hotspots
---Which districts and states consistently report higher crime loads overall and for specific categories (e.g., murder, rape, theft)?
​
3.Crimes against women
---How are offences such as rape, cruelty by husband/relatives, and sexual harassment distributed across districts and over time?
​
4.Property and economic crimes
---What is the spatial and temporal pattern of theft, robbery, dacoity, and economic offences like bank and ATM fraud?
​
5.District crime profiles
---Can districts be grouped into clusters based on their crime composition (e.g., high-violent vs high-property vs mixed)?
